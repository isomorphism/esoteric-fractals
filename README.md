## Esoteric Fractals ##

A celebration of the art of doing things the wrong way to the best of 
one's abilities.

Mostly a bunch of Mandelbrot renderers, written in languages--if you can call
them that--never intended for such purposes, because frankly it's much more
interesting than printing out "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall" or whatever else.

These may also serve as a warning: This is an exercise in hammering square 
screws into round metaphors and as such, should you ever find yourself writing 
code that resembles anything found here, suffice it to say you're using the 
very, very wrong tool for the job.
